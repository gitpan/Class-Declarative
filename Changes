Revision history for Class-Declarative

0.01    2010-02-15
        Got this thing uploaded to CPAN, with unit tests actually checking it first.

0.02    2010-02-16
        Upon restarting my work with Wx, immediately found egregious errors I had failed to test in the unit tests.
        Like the source filter didn't work because I changed the start function to be called.  Stupid stuff.

0.03    2010-02-17
        Added magic variables, did more little fixes.
        
0.04    2010-07-02
        Wrote a new parsing engine back in April.  Got things working on a fresh install of Strawberry (moved to
        a development laptop while traveling).

0.05	2010-07-09
	Sigh.  Forgot to add a file to MANIFEST.

0.06	2010-07-10
	Added another file the manifest and fixed some little formatting issues.

0.07    2010-12-05
        Changes to permit direct 'use' of semantic modules (e.g. 'use Wx::Declarative;' instead of 'use Class::Declarative qw(Wx::Declarative)')
        Added the ability to load a node using an arrayref of its components (first line, then children) instead of having to pass a text.
        Probably other stuff, but those two are the main reasons this version is being published.

0.08	2010-12-06
	Removed dependency on Tie::ExtraHash (it's perl >= 5.10, oops)
	Thanks, CPAN Daily Testers!
