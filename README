Class-Declarative

Class::Declarative is a framework for Perl allowing complex data structures
and some program logical structure to be declared instead of being built
in an initialization phase.

To make that possible, it also exposes a bunch of other convenient features
that make a variety of programming tasks much simpler and easier to understand.

For a lot more information, see the tutorial:

    perldoc Class::Declarative::Tutorial
    
Note that this is very much a work in progress.
